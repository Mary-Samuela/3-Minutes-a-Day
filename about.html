        <br><strong> 3 Minutes-a-Day with Jesus </strong> is a project born from the desire to help people

        <h3>Inspiration Behind the Project</h3>
        <img src="images/hope.png" alt="pilgrims of hope logo" class="hope">
        <p>This initiative was developed during the <strong>Jubilee of Communication</strong>
        in the <strong>Year of Hope</strong>
    a time to explore how technology and faith 
can meet to bring encouragement to the world.
This project demonstrates how digital places can be filled with light, peace and purpose</p>

        <p>Each verse diaplayed here is more than just text;
            It is a moment of reflection; a seed of hope planted in the digital soil of your day.

        <h3> Our Vision</h3>
        <p>We believe that Scripture, when encountered personally 
            and prayerfully, transforms hearts and reenews minds. 
            Our vision is to make the Word of God accessible, 
            meaningful and shareable - one verse at a time. 
         </p>
