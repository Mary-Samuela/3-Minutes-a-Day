**About the Project** 🚀
*3 Minutes-a-Day with Jesus is a page that helps people encounter the Word of God in their everyday lives. This site invites you to pause for a moment, breathe and draw from the fountain of God's Word whether you are beginning your day, seeking encouragement or ending your day in prayer.*

The structure incorporates 3 html pages that are linked to each other, a CSS page and a Java Script that brings out he functionality.
By the use of DOM and event handling and also an interactive User Interface, one is able to pick a date from the calendar and generate a verse from that particular day. Another option is to get a random verse without necessarily picking a date.

✨ **Features**
A responsive design styled with CSS and functional on JS
Interactive buttons
pick a date or random choice of verses

The contact page welcomes feedback from those who interact with the website whereby they can send an email.
